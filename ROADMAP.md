# Roadmap

This document represents the current working roadmap for Exflo. It is a living document, which will 
evolve and change over time. In particular the features in later versions are likely to be refined and change.

We use the approach of `#now`, `#next`, `#later` [used by foursquare](https://medium.com/@noah_weiss/now-next-later-roadmaps-without-the-drudgery-1cfe65656645), with a slightly different time horizon. Our `#now` scale is about 3 months, `#next` about 6 months, and `+later` is 12+ months.

## Now (up to v1.0.0)

## Next (v1.1)

## Future (v1.2)
